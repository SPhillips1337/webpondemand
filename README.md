# webpondemand
PHP Script to convert any image to webp on demand.

* Original version of the function is from JC Labs https://www.jclabs.co.uk/generate-webp-images-in-php-using-and-gd-or-imagick/ I updated it with a fix so that the webp files created using the built in PHP GD Library are generated correctly now so that the script works and the resulting files can be viewed and are not broken.

Added code to fix on Ln 55 to 57.

* I added some code to make this work with a .htaccess file using mod rewrite so that a variable called source gets passed to the script, and also updated the script to use this variable and if a webp image is found or generated to then pass through the immage with mime tpye headers to be loaded by the browser.

* I updated so all converted images are placed into a folder called webp
